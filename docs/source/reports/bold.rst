BOLD images
===========
One individual report per input functional timeseries will be generated
in the path ``<output_dir>/reports/sub-IDxxx_task-name_bold.html```.
An example report is given
`here <../_static/example_funcreport.html>`_.

The individual report for the functional images is structured as follows:

.. _reports-bold-summary:

Summary
-------
The first section summarizes some important information:

  * subject identifier, date and time of execution of
    ``mriqc``, software version;
  * workflow details and flags raised during execution; and
  * the extracted IQMs.

.. _reports-bold-visual:

Visual reports
--------------
The section with visual reports contains:

#. Mosaic view of the average BOLD signal.

   .. figure:: ../resources/reports-bold_mean.png
     :alt: mean epi mosaic

#. Mosaic view of the temporal standard deviation.

   .. figure:: ../resources/reports-bold_sd.png
     :alt: sd of epi mosaic

#. Summary plot, showing the slice-wise
   signal intensity at the extremes for the identification
   of spikes, the outliers metric, the DVARS and the
   :abbr:`FD (framewise displacement)`. Finally the
   so-called carpetplot [Power2016]_. 
   The carpet plot rows correspond to voxelwise time series,
   and are separated into regions: cortical gray matter, deep 
   gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, cerebellum 
   and the brain-edge or “crown” [Provins2022]_.
   The crown corresponds to the voxels located on a 
   closed band around the brain [Patriat2015]_.

.. _reports-bold-verbose:

Verbose reports
---------------
If mriqc was run with the ``--verbose-reports`` flag, the
following plots will be appended:

#. Mosaic view of the average BOLD signal, zoomed-in
   to the bounding box of brain activation.

   .. figure:: ../resources/reports-bold_mean_zoom.png
     :alt: zoomed mean epi mosaic

#. Mosaic view of the average BOLD signal, with background
   enhancement.

   .. figure:: ../resources/reports-bold_mean_bg.png
     :alt: mean epi background mosaic

#. One rows of axial views at different Z-axis points
   showing the calculated brain mask.

   .. figure:: ../resources/reports-bold_mask.png
     :alt: bold brainmasks

#. Mosaic view with animation for assessment of the
   co-registration to MNI space (roll over the image
   to activate the animation).

.. _reports-bold-metadata:

Metadata
--------
If some metadata was found in the BIDS structure, it is
reported here.
