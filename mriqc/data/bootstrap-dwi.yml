# This is a YAML-formatted file specifying how the NiReports assembler

title: '{filename} :: Diffusion MRI MRIQC report'
sections:
- name: Summary
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: summary, extension: [.html]}
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: heatmap}
    caption: This visualization divides the data by shells, and shows the joint distribution
      of SNR vs. FA. At the bottom, the distributions are marginalized for SNR.
      Please note that the figures of SNR provided are calculated with a coarse estimation of
      the signal variability, and therefore should be interpreted with care.
    subtitle: Shell-wise joint distribution of SNR vs. FA in every voxel
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: fa}
    caption: Reconstructed FA map.
    subtitle: Fractional anisotropy (FA) map
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: md}
    caption: Reconstructed MD map.
    subtitle: Mean diffusivity (MD) map
- name: DWI shells
  ordering: bval
  reportlets:
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: avgstd}
    caption: This panel shows mosaics flickering between the voxel-wise average and standard deviation
      for each shell.
    subtitle: Voxel-wise average and standard deviation across volumes in this <em>DWI shell</em>.
    static: false
  - bids: {datatype: figures, desc: background}
    caption: This panel shows a mosaic enhancing the background around the head.
      Artifacts usually unveil themselves in the air surrounding the head, where no signal
      sources are present.
    subtitle: View of the background of the voxel-wise average of this <em>DWI shell</em>

      Thanks for using <em>MRIQC</em>. The following information may assist in
      reconstructing the provenance of the corresponding derivatives.
