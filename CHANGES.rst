23.1.0 (June 14, 2023)
======================
A new minor release featuring the new individual reports built with the new
*NiReports* VRS (visual reports system). This means *MRIQC* now uses the same
package *fMRIPrep* uses for generating its reports. In addition to that,
this new release also features *Beta* support for diffusion MRI (dMRI).

=======================
The new 23.0.x series include several prominent changes.
Visualization has been migrated from *MRIQC* and *niworkflows* over to the new *NiReports* project.

22.0.0 (May 3rd, 2022)
======================
First official release after migrating the repository into the *NiPreps*' organization.
A major new feature is the rodent pipeline by Eilidh MacNicol (@eilidhmacnicol).
A second major feature is the adoption of the updated carpet plots for BOLD fMRI,
contributed by Céline Provins (@celprov).
Virtual memory allocation has been ten-fold cut down, and a complementary resource monitor instrumentation is now available with *MRIQC*.
This release updates the Docker image with up-to-date dependencies, updates
*MRIQC*'s codebase to the latest *NiTransforms* and includes some minor bugfixes.
The code, modules and data related to the MRIQC classifier have been extracted into an
isolated package called [*MRIQC-learn*](https://github.com/nipreps/mriqc-learn).
Finally, this release also contains a major code style overhaul by Zvi Baratz.

The contributor/author crediting system has been adapted to the current draft of the
*NiPreps Community* Governance documents.

With thanks to @ZviBaratz, @nbeliy, @octomike, @benkay86, @verdurin, @leej3, @utooley,
